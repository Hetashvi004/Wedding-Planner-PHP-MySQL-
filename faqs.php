             <h1>How Do You Charge For Services ??</h1>
             <h3>This is the big question that everyone wants to know. After all, planners have their own ways of charging for services.
                 Some have packages and event rates,while others charge hourly or by the service, and so forth. 
                 It’s less about how you charge and more about the fact that you’re willing to disclose that to people to help them 
                 get the information that they need. Make sure that you’re clear about all the options that you offer. 
                 Link to your services or pricing pages, too, to give people even more insight and answers if they want them. </h3>
                    <br>

                 <h1>Are Deposits Refundable ??</h1>
             <h3>In wedding and event planning, deposits are a big part of the process. Venues, caterers, and other event professionals
                 have their own deposits and requirements for their rates. People will want to know which deposits they can get back, 
                 as well as under what circumstances they can get a deposit refunded. Every single venue and caterer will be different,
                  and even your own planning deposits may vary. It doesn’t matter—what matters is explaining it all to people so that 
                  they know what they are getting into. 
                Bonus: If you can do anything to offer more flexibility with deposits, do it and make it known here because that could
                 be a great selling point for your services.  </h3>
                 <br>
            
                <h1>What if there’s an emergency? Can we change the date or details without additional fees??</h1>
             <h3>Some events have hiccups. Others have catastrophes. Almost always, there is at least one wedding on your planning
                 calendar that ends up needing to be rescheduled for one reason or another. This is your chance to tell people all 
                 about how you can help them with that, and what your policies are. Link to your cancellation page or policy page so 
                 that you can give people further details but keep the answer here informative and brief. </h3>
               <br>

               <h1>What is included in wedding planning services??</h1>
             <h3>Some people aren’t familiar with wedding planning and might not know what to expect. Others may just be aware that 
                all planners have their own services and solutions. Use this question to explain what’s generally included in wedding 
                planning, and then go into a full explanation of what your planning business does specifically. You can even explain 
                custom planning solutions, if you offer them, and invite people to contact you about getting an estimate or creating 
                the custom plan for their wedding so that they can get moving along.  </h3>
                <br>

                <h1>How much time do you need to plan??</h1>
             <h3>Weddings generally take at least 9-12 months to plan properly, but as you know, that will depend on the event itself. 
                Some weddings can be planned in weeks. Others may take years to pull off perfectly. Therefore, you’ll want to answer 
                this question for your audience carefully. Let them know that you need sufficient time to plan and explain what the 
                time accounts for. This is where you can explain the importance of booking a venue well in advance and planning ahead 
                to make sure that there are fewer compromises along the way. </h3>
                <br>

                <h1>How much experience do you have??</h1>
             <h3>People want to know that their wedding day is going to be perfect. Therefore, they’re not going to hire a planner that 
                just got started. Showcase your experience and expertise here. Tell people how long you’ve been doing event planning 
                and wedding planning and explain what kind of events you’ve handled in the past. It’s not just about how many weddings 
                you’ve planned or how many years you’ve been at it—you should also explain the types of events you’ve covered and the 
                vastness of your experience so that people get a full picture of what you can do for their wedding day.  </h3>
                <br>

                <h1>What’s it like to work with a wedding planner??</h1>
             <h3>People often ask this question because they want reassurance and understanding. Knowing what they are getting into 
                often gives people the chance to feel better about choosing to hire a planner in the first place. Use this Q&A to walk 
                people through the process of how you plan a wedding, including all the steps along the way. Allow for contingencies 
                and reassure them that this is just an example of the process and that their experience can be whatever they need. If 
                you are transparent and ease people’s worries, they will be more willing to choose your services and feel more 
                confident about what you have to offer. It also gives you a chance to showcase your expertise and build your reputation 
                as an expert in the industry.  </h3>
                <br>

                <h1>Do you have people to assist with setup, etc.??</h1>
             <h3>This is a big one for couples who are trying to make their day as smooth as possible. They are aware that you probably 
                don’t do the actual work of setting up the event yourself but need to know who will. If you have connections or if you 
                have a team of people that will help with the physical set up after the planning is complete, be sure to offer that to 
                people. If this is an extra service, tell them that here. If you just don’t offer it and they’ll have to find someone to
                do the setup and tear down for them elsewhere, again, let them know. </h3>
